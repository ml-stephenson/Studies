Ok, you took the first course in CodeAcademy, so you officially know everything.  For the inevitable moment you forget these fundamentals, future idiot, take heed:

# Generalizations

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve learned six commands commonly used to manage data stored in a relational database and how to set constraints on such data. What can we generalize so far?

- SQL is a programming language designed to manipulate and manage data stored in relational databases.
- A relational database is a database that organizes information into one or more tables.
- A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns.
- A statement is a string of characters that the database recognizes as a valid command.
1. CREATE TABLE creates a new table.
2. INSERT INTO adds a new row to a table.
3. SELECT queries data from a table.
4. ALTER TABLE changes an existing table.
5. UPDATE edits a row in a table.
6. DELETE FROM deletes rows from a table.

- Constraints add information about how a column can be used.
