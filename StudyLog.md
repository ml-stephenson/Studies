# Opening
Below you'll find my logs from each day I've worked within git, or just studied somewhere else and wrote information here.  Consistency is key, so I'll keep information flowing here to track myself.

If you're reading this, welcome.  If you'd like the professional version of me... well, work with me.  Otherwise you're going to be getting a direct insight into how I think, how I learn, and how I make stuff happen.... or fail.  Probably more of the latter.

Welcome aboard!

Oops.  Fun things you've forgotten since that wasted time in CodeAcademy.  Syncing to github requires that you not only commit, but you also have to push to origin.  Kind of, well, important.  

PUSH TO ORIGIN or it won't finish the process.
