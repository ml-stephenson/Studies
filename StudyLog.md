# Opening
Below you'll find my logs from each day I've worked within git, or hell just studied somewhere else and wrote information here.  Consistency is key, so I'll keep information flowing here to track myself.

If you're reading this, welcome.  Please be aware, I will not be censoring myself.  This is my study space, and I'm hitting it full speed.  If you'd like the professional, censored version of me... well, work with me.  Otherwise you're going to be getting a direct insight into how I think, how I learn, and how I make shit happen.... or fail.  Probably more of the latter.

Welcome aboard!

Well shit.  Fun things you've forgotten since that wasted time in CodeAcademy.  Syncing to github requires that you not only commit, but you also have to push to origin.  Kind of, well, important.  

PUSH TO ORIGIN or it won't finish the process.
