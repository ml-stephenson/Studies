### The Basics of Statistics
> "The Science of statistics is used to analyze large groups of numbers.  It can be used with spreadsheet software to build simple programs - these programs are called predictive models, and they can help do just that:  use statistics to predict the most probable future outcomes of a set of circumstances.  While predictive models, data analysis and data science are different, they all use the same related statistical tools."
